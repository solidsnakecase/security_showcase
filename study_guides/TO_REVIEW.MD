Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption which is faster and why?
What important problem does asymmetric cryptography solve? 
Why don‚Äôt we just use symmetric/asymmetric cryptography for everything? 

Hashing: Know all important properties (non-reversible, avalanche effect, quick computation, collision-resistant, deterministic)
hashing vs. encryption
How are passwords  hashed (using a salt, hashing is done multiple times to slow down attackers calculating the hash, through brute force or other tactics, all of this is often done using a key derivation function/password-hashing function). 
What are the effects of having a high iteration count for hashed passwords (whatever hashing you do on a password to slow down attacks, will be done when a user logs in)?
What is the tradeoff of not increasing the password iteration count too high (as users will experience more lag when logging in (the web server will need to take the password entered by the user, hash it multiple times, add in a salt the server knows then compare it with the hash stored in the database)). 
What is a hash collision? 
What makes a good or bad hash function? 
Give examples of how hashing is used besides passwords?
Salt and Pepper: Difference between both and why the salt is usually stored in plaintext.

Transport Layer Security (TLS): What it does, all handshake steps, modern/secure versions used (TLS 1.2 and 1.3), cipher suites (what each part of the cipher suite represents). 
Does TLS use TCP or UDP (technically, a trick question as TLS isn‚Äôt tied to any transport protocol but the answer an interviewer would likely expect is TCP)? 
Does TLS require TCP (it doesn‚Äôt as it only needs a reliable transport protocol, which TCP provides for the internet)?

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES): AES Modes (GCM vs. CBC). 
Which mode is more secure and why, (AES versions (256, 384, 512), AES always encrypts in 128 bits at a time, AES-128 is strong enough, though AES-256 is recommended.)
Plaintext vs. Ciphertext vs. Cleartext: Just knowing the definitions of each is enough.

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and RSA: Acknowledgement that asymmetric keys need to be larger to achieve the same level of security as symmetric keys. Asymmetric keys are weaker due to the complex math behind them. Bonus points if you know why. 
Know the key exchange process for an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. Other uses of asymmetric cryptography besides key exchange. 
Why prime numbers are important in cryptography? 
Why computers struggle to calculate prime numbers?
One-time Pad: Unlikely to come up but I think you‚Äôll impress your interviewer if you remember this.
Cryptographic Keys: The strength of the encryption is dependent on the strength of the key (size and entropy) and other factors (i.e. strength of encryption algorithm). 
Different forms of key derivation (PRNG-generated key (i.e. using Random/SecureRandom class in Java), key generated via asymmetric cryptography, key derivation functions. 
Know the name of a key derivation function (i.e. PBKDF2) and why they‚Äôre used when generating things like passwords. 
What is key stretching?
Entropy: What it is and how it relates to cybersecurity.
SSL/TLS Certificates: Why they‚Äôre important, understand how its related to the padlock icon showed on browsers, certificate authority, Java truststore vs. keystore, self-signed certificate.
XOR (Exclusive Or ‚Äî a boolean operation): Why XOR is extremely important in cybersecurity.
Types of Encryption: Payload encryption (i.e. encrypted HTTP body) vs. in-transit encryption (i.e. TLS) vs. at-rest encryption (i.e. encrypting data stored on a hard drive/SSD).
Nonce: Define it and give an example of how it can be used (i.e. in an encryption algorithm, a nonce can be used to add more entropy). 
What is an initialization vector (IV)? Give an example of its usage. 
What is the difference between an IV and a nonce?
Random Number Generators: Understand why computers can‚Äôt generate truly random numbers? This is why random number generators used by computers, are called ‚Äúpseudorandom‚Äù (fake) number generators (PRNGs).
Secrecy: Forward secrecy (aka perfect forward secrecy).
Crypto Algorithms: Know the names of popular crypto algorithms (new and old): ECDH, ECHDE, AES, DES, 3DES, RC4, RC5, SHA1, RSA, SSL, TLS. This is just in case you get asked to name algorithms, give examples of old algorithms or some other trivia-like question.
Password Attacks: Dictionary attack, rainbow table attack
Databases: SQL injection (what it is, how to protect against it, knowing that its a common vulnerability)
Networking: Denial of service (DoS) attack , distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, man-in-the-middle attack
Perfect Security: There‚Äôs no such thing as ‚Äúperfect security‚Äù. A secure system is only as strong as the weakest link (which is often the user). There will always be new vulnerabilities discovered, employee-targeted phishing attacks and more powerful computers to help crack crypto algorithms.
Security via Obscurity: Obscurity can provide some extra security but it can‚Äôt be relied upon. The attacker sometimes knows the system/algorithm. For example, attackers know the inner workings of all popular crypto algorithms but many of them are still secure. It may be helpful to assume they do know to adopt a healthier security mindset. In the real world, most systems are obscure (their internal architecture and code base is private), so obscurity isn‚Äôt inherently bad. It‚Äôs seen as bad, typically when it‚Äôs relied upon, instead of primary defensive protections.
Security Isn‚Äôt an ‚ÄúEnd State‚Äù: Security engineers and hackers play an endless game of cat üò∫ and mouse üê≠. Cats (security engineers) are adept hunters and even emit a chemical that deters mice (hackers). Although, cats alone may not stop mice from entering a home. Mice continue to learn clever ways to avoid cats (like traveling through walls). Just like these archenemies, security engineers work on improving security while hackers discover clever ways of breaking into systems.
Too Much Security: Be careful what you wish for ü™Ñ. More security can lead to worse performance (TLS introduces more latency), a worse user experience (imagine needing two factor authentication every time you logged into your bank account on the same laptop) and can cost more money than its worth (a security company may over-engineer a security solution). For example, is a 200 character password limit necessary? Security additions like these may not add enough value to justify their investment and could deter end users depending on the consequences.
Don‚Äôt Reinvent the Wheel: Just like in software engineering, we want to reuse things (authentication services, crypto algorithms, security tools). For example, creating your own hash or encryption algorithm is discouraged as there‚Äôs likely an existing solution that‚Äôs appropriate. There‚Äôre entire teams, researchers, managers, etc. dedicated to working on popular security tools and algorithms. The consequences for an insecure implementation can be catastrophic üî•.
Security As an Onion: What do onions üßÖ and secure systems have in common üëÄ? Layers and lots of them! Consider a web application for a hypothetical online clothing store called ‚ÄúShopolisa‚Äù that‚Äôs hosted in the cloud (AWS). In AWS‚Äô data centers, there‚Äôs physical locks on doors. On Shopolisa‚Äôs AWS servers, automated patching is done to apply monthly security updates to the operating system. The data of retail customers is encrypted at rest. All these protections provide security against different attacks. It‚Äôs important to not ignore other layers and additional defensive-in-depth protections.
Understanding hashing, study cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery and server-side request forgery, OWASP Top 10, OAuth and authentication (session vs. token authentication), incident response, threat modeling and least-privilege permissions.

if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
    $userId = $_POST['userId'];
    $newEmail = $_POST['newEmail'];
    updateEmail($userId, $newEmail);
}

in.close();

Identify the security issue in this code snippet and explain how you would fix it. [Hint: password hashing issue]
import hashlib
def store_password(password):
    hashed_password = hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()
    save_to_database(hashed_password)

Which security issue it can cause? [Hint: XSS]
const userInput = request.query.userInput;
const output = "<div>" + userInput + "</div>";
response.send(output);
