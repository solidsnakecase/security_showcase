# Starting Your Prep

Track concepts - "To learn", "Revising", "Done"

Study cards can help, especially with topics you are weak on.

"To learn", "Revising", "Done" was written on my whiteboard and I moved my post-its between these categories, I attended to this every few days.
Look up terms everyday, and practice recalling terms and explaining them to yourself every time you remember you have these interviews coming up (frequently).
Focus on the most difficult topics first before moving onto easier topics.
I carried around a notebook and wrote down terms and explanations.
Using paper reduces distractions.
How to review concepts

Use spaced-repetition.
Don't immediately look up the answer, EVEN IF you have never seen the term before. Ask yourself what the term means. Guess the answer. Then look it up.
Review terms all the time. You can review items in your head at any time. If I was struggling to fall asleep, I'd go through terms in my head and explained them to myself. 100% success rate of falling asleep in less than 10 minutes, works every time.
Target your learning

Think hard about what specific team you are going for, what skills do they want? If you aren't sure, then ask someone who will definitely know.
Always focus on the areas you struggle with the most first in a study session. Then move on to easier or more familiar topics.
Identify what you need to work on

Spend more time doing the difficult things.
If you're weak on coding and you find yourself avoiding it, then spend most of your study time doing that.
Read

Read relevant books (you don't have to read back to back).
When looking up things online, avoid going more than two referral links deep - this will save you from browser tab hell.
Mental health

Take care of your basic needs first - sleep, eat well, drink water, gentle exercise. You know yourself, so do what's best for you.
You are more than your economic output, remember to separate your self worth from your paycheque.
See interviews for what they are - they are not a measure of you being "good enough".
