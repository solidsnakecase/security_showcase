# Behavioural Question Prep

## Tips

Interview questions are intentionally vague. This is to encourage questions.
Ask clarifying questions
Questions reveal how you approach problems.
Write down notes about the question. This is so you don't forget details and only partially answer, or give the wrong answer.
Interviews should be more like a conversation with a lot of back and forth, thoroughly explore scenarios together and avoid jumping too fast to a solution.
The interviewer can only make an evaluation on your suitability for the job based on the things you say.
Interviewers test depth of knowledge
There will be questions about technical details on topics to the point where it'll be hard to answer. This is okay, try your best to work through it and say what you're thinking.
Interviewers often aren't looking for specific answers, they just want to see how deeply you know a topic.
Approach the question from a low level and even ask your interviewer if you need to add more details before moving on.
Interviewers test breadth of knowledge
There will be questions related to the role you're applying for and some that aren't. This is to explore breadth of knowledge.
Try your best to explore the scenarios and ask questions. It's very important to say your thinking aloud, you might be on the right track.
Show comprehension

Try to always ask clarifying questions even if you think you already know the answer. You might learn some nuance that even improves your idea.
Always repeat the question back to the interviewer to both check your understanding and give yourself thinking time.
"Okay, I'll repeat back the question so I can check my understanding…"
"Just to clarify…"
"I just want to check I heard correctly…"
State your assumptions

Your interviewer will provide feedback if your assumptions are unreasonable.
"I am going to assume that the organisation is collecting x,y,z logs from hosts and storing these for at least 90 days…"
"Can I make the assumption that…?"
"Let's say that we can get x,y,z information…"
When asked a question you're not sure of the answer to right away, try these phrases:

"I don't know but if I had to invent it, it would be like this…"
"I don't know that exactly but I know something about a similar subject / sub component…"
"This is what's popping into my mind right now is…"
"The only thing that is coming to mind is…"
"I know a lot about [similar thing], I could talk about that instead? Would that be okay?"
Say what you are thinking

The interviewer can only make an evaluation on your suitability for the job based on the things you say.
If you don't say your thought process aloud, then the interviewer doesn't know what you know.
You may well be on the right track with an answer. You'll be kicking yourself afterwards if you later realise you were but didn't say anything (I missed out on an internship because of this!).
Write pseudo code for your coding solution so you don't have to hold everything in your head.
"Right now I am thinking about…"
"I am thinking about different approaches, for example…"
"I keep coming back to [subject/idea/thing] but I think that's not the right direction. I am thinking about…"
"I'm interested in this idea that…"
Reduce cognitive load

Take notes on the question and assumptions during the interview.
If the infrastructure is complicated, draw up what you think it looks like.
Write pseudocode.
Write tests and expected output for code you write, test your code against it.
Prepare

Make a checklist that reminds you of what to do for each question, something like:
Listen to interview question
Take notes on the question
Repeat the question
Ask clarifying questions
State any assumptions
Prepare questions that you want to ask your interviewers at the end of the interview so you don't need to think of them on the spot on the day. Since an interview is also for you to know more about the workplace, I asked questions about the worst parts of the job.
Bring some small snacks in a box or container that isn't noisy and distracting. A little bit of sugar throughout the interviews can help your problem solving abilities.
Stay hydrated - and take a toilet break between every interview if you need to (it's good to take a quiet moment).
Do practice interviews

Do them until they feel more comfortable and you can easily talk through problems.
Ask your friends/peers to give you really hard questions that you definitely don't know how to answer.
Practice being in the very uncomfortable position where you have no idea about the topic you've been asked. Work through it from first principles.
Practice speaking aloud everything you know about a topic, even details you think might be irrelevant.
Interviewers are potential friends and they want to help you get the job, they are on your side. Let them help you, ask them questions, recite everything you know on a topic and say your thought process out loud.

## Questions for the Interviewer

What's your typical day like?

How does career progression work?

What are some of the things you're looking for when it comes to career success at this company?

What is their biggest challenge?

Q: When was the last time you promoted someone on your team? How did it happen?

Why: It's highly likely your experience will be similar when you ask for a promotion yourself under this person. So make sure their answer is something you'd be happy to live out.

Q: Why did the last person in this role leave?

Why: Unless this is a new position, the reason that someone left can be very telling. Worst case: they quit because of a toxic workplace. Best case: they were promoted up, meaning this role can lead to similar opportunities for you.

Q: How do you nurture psychological safety in your team?

Why: The workplace may be challenging, but it should never be threatening. A manager who intentionally fosters a sense of acceptance and respect can be the reason you love your job.

Q: When was the last time you supported a direct report's growth, even if it meant leaving your team or company?

Why: A supportive manager cares about your goals, not gluing you to your seat. The very best managers realize when it's time to move you up.

Q: Most/all of my interviewers were men. Can I speak to some women on the team to hear more about their experience?

Why: This happens. A lot. Having zero representation of someone like you can be a very bad sign of how the team respects diverse perspectives.
