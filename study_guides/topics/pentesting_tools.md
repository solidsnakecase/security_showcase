Session Hijacking: Allows attackers to interfere with or hijack user sessions by manipulating HTTP requests to confuse servers and proxies.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Can lead to XSS attacks by injecting malicious payloads into request headers or bodies that are later executed by the web application.
Cache Poisoning: Can poison cache entries, leading to serving malicious content to users or disrupting the functionality of the application.
Data Leakage: May expose sensitive information by tricking the server into processing requests in unintended ways.
HTTP Request Smuggling attacks exploit inconsistencies in request parsing between different components in the web infrastructure, potentially compromising the integrity and security of web applications.

- How do you test for SQL injection without using any tools?

To test for SQL injection without using tools, follow these steps:

Identify Input Fields: Locate input fields such as search boxes, login forms, or URL parameters where user input is processed.

Inject Payloads: Manually input common SQL injection payloads into these fields. Examples include:

' OR '1'='1
' UNION SELECT NULL, username, password FROM users--
' OR 1=1--
'; DROP TABLE users;--
Observe Behavior: Look for abnormal behavior or errors that indicate an SQL injection vulnerability, such as:

Database error messages
Unexpected application behavior or data exposure
Error-Based Testing: Insert payloads that trigger SQL errors to gain insights into the database structure. For example:

' AND 1=CONVERT(int, @@version)--
' OR 1=1 GROUP BY CONCAT(username, 0x3a, password)--
Blind Injection Testing: Use boolean-based or time-based blind SQL injection techniques if no error messages are visible. Examples include:

Boolean-based: ' AND 1=1-- and ' AND 1=2-- (compare responses)
Time-based: ' OR IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0)-- (check if response is delayed)
Review Results: Analyze the responses for signs of successful injection or data leakage.

These steps involve manually testing input fields and interpreting responses to identify SQL injection vulnerabilities.
