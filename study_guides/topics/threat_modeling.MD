- What are the Common Threat Modeling Frameworks?

STRIDE: Focuses on Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.
PASTA: Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis, which emphasizes the simulation of attacks to assess potential threats.
OCTAVE: Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation, focusing on organizational and operational aspects.

- What is a threat matrix, and how is it used in threat modeling?

A threat matrix is a tool used in threat modeling to systematically document and analyze potential threats to a system, application, or network. It helps organize and prioritize threats based on various factors, such as their impact, likelihood, and the system’s vulnerabilities.

How it’s used in threat modeling:

Identify Threats: List potential threats and attack vectors relevant to the system. Each threat is described in terms of how it might exploit vulnerabilities.

Define Impact and Likelihood:

Impact: Assess the potential damage or consequences if the threat is realized (e.g., data breach, financial loss).
Likelihood: Estimate the probability of the threat occurring based on current security controls and known vulnerabilities.
Create the Matrix:

Rows: Represent different threats.
Columns: Represent different factors such as impact, likelihood, and the affected assets or components.
Cells: Populate with scores or qualitative assessments for each threat based on the defined factors.
Analyze:

Prioritization: Use the matrix to prioritize threats based on their potential impact and likelihood. This helps focus on the most critical threats that need to be addressed.
Risk Assessment: Evaluate the overall risk level for each threat by combining impact and likelihood scores.
Develop Mitigation Strategies:

Address High-Risk Threats: Develop and implement security measures to mitigate the most critical threats identified in the matrix.
Review and Update: Regularly review and update the threat matrix to reflect changes in the system, emerging threats, and the effectiveness of implemented controls.
The threat matrix provides a structured and visual way to assess and prioritize security threats, aiding in effective risk management and resource allocation.

- What are trust boundaries, and why are they important in threat modeling?

Trust Boundaries:

Definition: Trust boundaries are the points in a system where data or control transitions from one security domain or trust level to another. These boundaries define areas where different levels of trust are applied, such as between user input and internal processing or between external services and internal components.

Importance in Threat Modeling:

Identify Weak Points: Trust boundaries are often where vulnerabilities are exploited. Understanding these boundaries helps in identifying critical areas that may be susceptible to attacks.

Focus on Input Validation: Data crossing a trust boundary should be validated and sanitized to prevent attacks like injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other input-based vulnerabilities.

Apply Different Security Controls: Different security measures may be required on either side of a trust boundary. For instance, stricter controls might be needed for data entering the system from an untrusted source compared to data within the trusted internal environment.

Reduce Attack Surface: By clearly defining and securing trust boundaries, you can minimize the potential attack surface and ensure that attacks do not propagate from less trusted areas to more sensitive parts of the system.

Ensure Proper Authentication and Authorization: Trust boundaries often require authentication and authorization checks to ensure that data and control transitions are properly secured.

Incorporating trust boundaries into threat modeling helps to systematically analyze where and how security controls should be applied, ultimately improving the overall security posture of the system.

- What role do security controls play in threat modeling?

Security Controls:

Definition: Security controls are measures or mechanisms put in place to mitigate risks and protect systems from threats. They can be technical (e.g., firewalls, encryption), administrative (e.g., policies, training), or physical (e.g., access controls, surveillance).

Role in Threat Modeling:

Risk Mitigation: Security controls are designed to address identified threats and vulnerabilities by reducing their likelihood or impact. They help in determining which threats are mitigated and which need further attention.

Identify Control Gaps: During threat modeling, security controls are evaluated to identify gaps or weaknesses. This helps in understanding which threats might still be exploitable due to insufficient controls.

Prioritize Threats: By analyzing the effectiveness of existing controls, you can prioritize threats based on the remaining risk after controls are applied. This helps focus resources on the most critical areas.

Assess Effectiveness: Evaluating how well current security controls mitigate specific threats helps in assessing the overall security posture. It ensures that controls are properly implemented and functioning as intended.

Guide Control Implementation: Threat modeling informs the design and implementation of additional or enhanced security controls to address identified threats. It helps in ensuring that controls are tailored to the specific needs and risks of the system.

In summary, security controls are integral to threat modeling as they help in mitigating identified risks, addressing control gaps, and guiding the implementation of effective security measures.

- What is the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and how is it used for understanding and defending against attacks?

MITRE ATT&CK Framework:

Definition: The MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) framework is a comprehensive knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It provides a structured approach to understanding and defending against cyber attacks.

Uses in Understanding and Defending Against Attacks:

Threat Modeling: Helps in identifying and mapping out potential attack techniques that adversaries might use against your system. This informs threat modeling by providing a detailed view of tactics and techniques.

Incident Response: Guides incident response teams by offering a reference for understanding the tactics and techniques used in attacks. It helps in identifying the behavior patterns of attackers and responding more effectively.

Threat Hunting: Assists in proactively searching for indicators of compromise (IoCs) and techniques within your environment. It enables security teams to look for specific tactics and techniques that match known attack methods.

Security Assessments: Provides a basis for assessing and improving security controls by mapping them to ATT&CK techniques. It helps in identifying gaps and strengthening defenses against specific attack methods.

Red Teaming and Penetration Testing: Red teams use the framework to simulate real-world attacks by employing the techniques documented in ATT&CK. This helps in testing and validating security measures and defenses.

Training and Awareness: Serves as an educational tool for security professionals to understand attack techniques and improve their ability to recognize and respond to threats.

Structure:

Tactics: The overarching goals or objectives that attackers aim to achieve (e.g., initial access, execution, persistence).
Techniques: Specific methods used to accomplish each tactic (e.g., phishing for initial access, command and control for maintaining control).
Sub-techniques: More detailed methods within each technique that provide further granularity.
The MITRE ATT&CK framework provides a detailed and actionable reference for understanding adversary behavior, improving security defenses, and enhancing incident response and threat detection capabilities.

- What are the stages of an attack (e.g., cyber kill chain)?

The Cyber Kill Chain is a model used to describe the stages of a cyber attack. It helps in understanding the attack lifecycle and enhancing defensive measures. The stages are:

Reconnaissance:

Description: The attacker gathers information about the target system or organization to identify potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
Activities: Scanning networks, researching employees, and collecting data from public sources.
Weaponization:

Description: The attacker creates a malicious payload or exploit based on the information gathered. This often involves developing or acquiring malware.
Activities: Crafting phishing emails, creating exploit kits, or preparing malicious documents.
Delivery:

Description: The attacker delivers the weaponized payload to the target. This is the phase where the attack is initiated.
Activities: Sending phishing emails, using infected websites, or deploying exploit scripts.
Exploitation:

Description: The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the target system to execute the payload and gain initial access.
Activities: Executing malicious code, exploiting software vulnerabilities, or leveraging social engineering.
Installation:

Description: The attacker installs malware or establishes a foothold in the target system to maintain access and persist in the environment.
Activities: Installing backdoors, setting up rootkits, or creating new user accounts with elevated privileges.
Command and Control (C2):

Description: The attacker establishes a communication channel with the compromised system to control it and exfiltrate data or issue commands.
Activities: Setting up communication channels, using remote access tools, or managing compromised systems.
Actions on Objectives:

Description: The attacker takes actions to achieve their ultimate goals, such as data theft, system disruption, or further penetration into the network.
Activities: Exfiltrating data, encrypting files for ransom, or moving laterally to other systems.
Understanding the stages of the Cyber Kill Chain helps in developing strategies to detect, prevent, and respond to attacks at various points in the attack lifecycle.
