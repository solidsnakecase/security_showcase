## Threat Modeling & Secure Architecture
What are threat models and threat modeling, and why are they important?

Describe how you would conduct threat modeling for a cloud-native application. What specific security concerns are most critical in any cloud native application?

How would you perform threat modeling for a given web application?

1. Define the Scope
Identify the Assets: Determine what assets need protection, such as data, applications, and infrastructure.
Define the Boundaries: Establish the boundaries of the system, including the network topology and interactions with external systems.
2. Create an Architecture Overview
System Diagram: Develop a detailed diagram of the system architecture, including components, data flows, and interactions between them.
Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs): Create DFDs to visualize how data moves through the system, highlighting input, processing, and output points.
3. Identify Threats
Threat Identification: Use techniques such as brainstorming, historical data, or threat intelligence to identify potential threats.
Threat Categories: Classify threats into categories such as external attacks, insider threats, or environmental factors.
4. Assess Vulnerabilities
Vulnerability Scanning: Perform vulnerability scans to identify weaknesses in the system.
Review Security Controls: Assess the effectiveness of existing security controls and identify gaps.
5. Evaluate Risks
Impact and Likelihood: Assess the potential impact and likelihood of each identified threat exploiting a vulnerability.
Risk Prioritization: Prioritize risks based on their potential impact and likelihood, focusing on the most critical issues first.
6. Develop Mitigation Strategies
Implement Controls: Develop and implement security controls to mitigate identified threats and vulnerabilities.
Update Security Measures: Regularly review and update security measures to address new threats and vulnerabilities.
7. Review and Update
Continuous Monitoring: Continuously monitor the system for new threats and vulnerabilities.
Periodic Review: Regularly review and update the threat model to reflect changes in the system and its environment.

- How would you design the security architecture to protect a physical system?

- Go over a specific product and describe how you would threat model for it.

- What are the Common Threat Modeling Frameworks?
STRIDE: Focuses on Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.
PASTA: Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis, which emphasizes the simulation of attacks to assess potential threats.
OCTAVE: Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation, focusing on organizational and operational aspects.

- What is a threat matrix, and how is it used in threat modeling?

- What are trust boundaries, and why are they important in threat modeling?

- What role do security controls play in threat modeling?

- What is the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and how is it used for understanding and defending against attacks?

- What are the stages of an attack (e.g., cyber kill chain)?
