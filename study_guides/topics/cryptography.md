## Cryptography & Encryption
- What is salt and pepper in cryptography?

Salt: A random value added to a password before hashing to ensure unique hashes for identical passwords. This defends against precomputed attacks like rainbow tables.

Pepper: A secret value added to a password or hash, but not stored with the hash. It's used alongside salt for additional security, making it harder for attackers to crack hashes even if they gain access to the database.

- Which method is secure: Compress First and then Encrypt the data or Encrypt First then Compress?

Encrypt First, then Compress is generally more secure. Compressing before encryption can reveal patterns in the data, which could help attackers. Encrypting first hides these patterns, making the data less vulnerable to analysis.

- Explain encryption in Wi-Fi network communication.

Encryption in Wi-Fi network communication protects data transmitted between devices and access points from eavesdropping. Common methods include:

WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy): An older, less secure standard with known vulnerabilities.
WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access): Improved security over WEP with stronger encryption (TKIP).
WPA2: Uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for stronger encryption and is currently the most widely used standard.
WPA3: The latest standard, offering enhanced security features like improved protection against brute-force attacks and better encryption.
Encryption ensures that data sent over the air is scrambled and can only be read by devices with the correct decryption keys.

- What is the difference between hashing and encryption? Provide examples of each.

Hashing and encryption serve different purposes in security:

Hashing:

Purpose: Converts data into a fixed-size hash value (digest) that uniquely represents the original data.
One-way: Hashing is irreversible; you cannot retrieve the original data from the hash.
Use Cases: Data integrity checks, password storage.
Examples: MD5, SHA-256.
Encryption:

Purpose: Converts data into a different format to protect its confidentiality, which can be reversed with the appropriate decryption key.
Two-way: Encrypted data can be decrypted back to its original form.
Use Cases: Protecting data during transmission, securing files.
Examples: AES, RSA.
Summary: Hashing is used for integrity and uniqueness checks, while encryption is used for protecting data confidentiality.

- Explain the process of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and how it works.

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a framework for managing digital certificates and public-key encryption. Here‚Äôs a simplified overview:

Components:

Public and Private Keys: Each user has a pair of keys. The public key is shared openly, while the private key is kept secret.
Certificate Authority (CA): A trusted entity that issues digital certificates.
Registration Authority (RA): Acts as an intermediary that verifies user identities before certificates are issued by the CA.
Digital Certificates: Contain public keys and user identities, signed by the CA to verify authenticity.
Certificate Revocation List (CRL): A list of certificates that have been revoked before their expiration date.
Process:

Key Pair Generation: Users generate a pair of keys (public and private).
Certificate Request: Users send a certificate signing request (CSR) containing their public key to the RA.
Identity Verification: The RA verifies the user's identity and forwards the CSR to the CA.
Certificate Issuance: The CA issues a digital certificate that includes the user‚Äôs public key and identity, signed by the CA.
Certificate Usage: The certificate is used for secure communication. The public key encrypts data, which can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key.
Certificate Revocation: If a certificate needs to be invalidated, the CA adds it to the CRL.
Summary: PKI ensures secure communications and authentication by using public and private keys, certificates, and a trusted authority (CA) to validate identities.

- Can two files generate the same checksum? Explain how and under what circumstances.

Yes, two different files can generate the same checksum, a phenomenon known as a collision. This occurs because checksums (or hash functions) produce fixed-size outputs regardless of the input size, leading to a finite number of possible hash values.

How Collisions Happen:

Hash Function Properties: A hash function maps input data to a fixed-size string of characters. Since there are more possible inputs than outputs, multiple inputs can produce the same output.
Cryptographic Hash Collisions: Insecure or weak hash functions may have known vulnerabilities that make it easier to find collisions. For example, MD5 and SHA-1 are vulnerable to collision attacks.
Circumstances:

Hash Function Limitations: Hash functions with smaller bit lengths are more prone to collisions. For instance, MD5 produces a 128-bit hash, which is more likely to experience collisions than SHA-256.
Intentional Attacks: Attackers can use techniques like the birthday attack to deliberately find two different inputs that produce the same hash.
Mitigation: Use strong cryptographic hash functions with longer bit lengths (e.g., SHA-256 or SHA-3) and stay updated with best practices to reduce the risk of collisions.

- What are the different types of encryption (e.g., symmetric, asymmetric)? Provide examples.

1. Symmetric Encryption:

Definition: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
Examples:
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): Widely used for securing data.
DES (Data Encryption Standard): An older standard, now considered insecure.
3DES (Triple DES): An improvement over DES, but less secure compared to AES.
2. Asymmetric Encryption:

Definition: Uses a pair of keys‚Äîa public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
Examples:
RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman): Commonly used for secure data transmission and digital signatures.
ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography): Provides strong security with shorter key lengths, used in modern systems like TLS.
ElGamal: Used in some cryptographic systems and protocols.
3. Hybrid Encryption:

Definition: Combines symmetric and asymmetric encryption to leverage the strengths of both. Typically, asymmetric encryption is used to exchange a symmetric key, which is then used for the actual data encryption.
Example: TLS (Transport Layer Security) uses asymmetric encryption to establish a secure connection and then switches to symmetric encryption for the data transfer.

- What is the difference between asymmetric and symmetric encryption? What are their key differences and use cases?

Asymmetric Encryption:

Key Usage: Uses a pair of keys‚Äîpublic and private.
Encryption: Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key.
Decryption: Data decrypted with the private key can only be encrypted with the public key.
Performance: Slower due to complex algorithms.
Use Cases: Secure data exchange, digital signatures, and certificate-based authentication (e.g., HTTPS).
Symmetric Encryption:

Key Usage: Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.
Encryption: Data encrypted with the key can be decrypted with the same key.
Decryption: Data decrypted with the key can be encrypted with the same key.
Performance: Faster due to simpler algorithms.
Use Cases: Bulk data encryption, secure file storage, and data encryption in transit (e.g., AES in VPNs).
Key Differences:

Key Management: Asymmetric requires managing two keys (public and private), while symmetric requires a single key.
Performance: Symmetric is generally faster and more efficient for large amounts of data.
Security Use: Asymmetric is used for secure key exchange and digital signatures; symmetric is used for encrypting large volumes of data efficiently.

- What is Diffie-Hellman, and how does it contribute to secure communications?

Diffie-Hellman is a cryptographic algorithm used to securely exchange cryptographic keys over a public channel. It enables two parties to establish a shared secret key that can be used for encrypted communication, even if they have never communicated before and without requiring a previously shared secret.

How It Works:

Public Parameters: Both parties agree on a large prime number 
ùëù
p and a base 
ùëî
g (also known as a generator). These values are public.
Private Keys: Each party generates a private key (
ùëé
a for Alice and 
ùëè
b for Bob) that remains secret.
Public Keys: Each party computes a public key using the formula:
Alice computes

Contribution to Secure Communications:

Key Exchange: Diffie-Hellman allows secure exchange of encryption keys over an unsecure channel.
Foundation for Protocols: It is a foundational algorithm for various secure communication protocols, such as HTTPS and VPNs.
Forward Secrecy: It supports forward secrecy by allowing the generation of new keys for each session, protecting past communications even if the current key is compromised.

- What is the difference between encryption, encoding, and hashing? Why is "password" considered a bad password?

Encryption vs. Encoding vs. Hashing:

Encryption:
Purpose: To protect data by converting it into a format that is unreadable without a decryption key.
Reversible: Yes, with the correct key.
Example: AES, RSA.
Encoding:
Purpose: To transform data into a different format for readability or transmission, not for security.
Reversible: Yes, the original data can be recovered.
Example: Base64, URL encoding.
Hashing:
Purpose: To produce a fixed-size hash value from input data, often used for data integrity and storage.
Reversible: No, it‚Äôs a one-way function.
Example: SHA-256, MD5.
Why "password" is a bad password:

Predictability: It is a common and easily guessed password.
Lack of Complexity: It lacks numbers, special characters, and uppercase letters, making it weak against attacks.
Commonly Used: It's often used in brute-force and dictionary attacks.

- How does Gmail ensure that your emails are not read by hackers while they are being pushed out to you?

Gmail ensures email security through several mechanisms:

TLS Encryption: Gmail uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt emails in transit between servers. This protects emails from being intercepted and read by unauthorized parties.

End-to-End Encryption: While Gmail doesn‚Äôt offer end-to-end encryption by default, it ensures that emails are encrypted in transit. For enhanced security, users can use third-party services or plugins that provide end-to-end encryption.

OAuth2 Authentication: Gmail uses OAuth2 for secure authentication, which reduces the risk of password exposure during the login process.

Spam and Phishing Detection: Gmail employs advanced algorithms and machine learning to detect and filter out malicious emails, protecting users from phishing attempts and spam.

Secure Connections: Gmail uses HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between your browser and Google's servers, ensuring that your email content is secure when accessed through a web browser.

- What is public-key cryptography?

Public-key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses a pair of keys: a public key and a private key.

Public Key: Used to encrypt data or verify a digital signature. It can be shared openly.
Private Key: Used to decrypt data or create a digital signature. It must be kept secret.
How it Works:

Encryption: Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key.
Digital Signatures: A message signed with a private key can be verified by anyone using the corresponding public key, ensuring authenticity and integrity.
Use Cases:

Secure communications
Digital signatures
Secure key exchange
Example: In an email encryption scenario, a sender encrypts the email with the recipient‚Äôs public key. Only the recipient, with their private key, can decrypt and read the email.

- State the difference between private and public-key cryptography while performing encryption and signing content.
Mention the major applications of public-key cryptography.

Difference between Private and Public-Key Cryptography:

Encryption:

Public-Key Cryptography: Encrypts data with the recipient's public key. Only the recipient‚Äôs private key can decrypt the data.
Private-Key Cryptography: Encrypts and decrypts data using the same secret key. Both parties must securely share and store the key.
Signing:

Public-Key Cryptography: Signs data with the sender's private key. The signature can be verified by anyone using the sender‚Äôs public key.
Private-Key Cryptography: Cannot be used for signing as it relies on a single shared key, not a key pair.
Major Applications of Public-Key Cryptography:

Secure Email: Encrypts emails and ensures secure communication.
Digital Signatures: Verifies the authenticity and integrity of documents and transactions.
SSL/TLS: Secures web traffic through encrypted connections between browsers and servers.
Cryptocurrencies: Manages transactions and secure blockchain networks.
Key Exchange: Safely exchanges encryption keys over an insecure channel.

- Explain the differences between block ciphers and stream ciphers.

Block Ciphers:

Operation: Encrypts data in fixed-size blocks (e.g., 128 bits).
Example: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
Mode of Operation: Can operate in different modes like CBC (Cipher Block Chaining), ECB (Electronic Codebook), etc.
Strengths: Provides strong encryption and is suitable for large data blocks.
Drawbacks: Can be less efficient for streaming data and requires padding for data not aligned to block size.
Stream Ciphers:

Operation: Encrypts data one bit or byte at a time, using a keystream generated from a secret key.
Example: RC4.
Mode of Operation: Processes data as a continuous stream.
Strengths: Efficient for real-time data and variable-length data.
Drawbacks: Can be less secure if not implemented correctly; requires careful management of keystreams to avoid vulnerabilities.

- Encryption vs Hashing vs Encoding vs Obfuscation

Encryption:

Purpose: To protect data confidentiality by converting plaintext into ciphertext.
Reversible: Yes, requires a key for both encryption and decryption.
Use Case: Securing data during transmission or storage (e.g., AES for files).
Hashing:

Purpose: To produce a fixed-size hash value from input data, ensuring data integrity.
Reversible: No, designed to be a one-way function.
Use Case: Storing passwords, verifying data integrity (e.g., SHA-256).

Purpose: To convert data into a different format for compatibility or readability.
Reversible: Yes, encoding can be reversed to retrieve original data.
Use Case: Data transmission (e.g., Base64 for email attachments).
Obfuscation:

Purpose: To make data less understandable or recognizable, but not to provide security.
Reversible: Yes, with knowledge of the obfuscation method.
Use Case: Hiding code or data structure to deter casual inspection (e.g., obfuscating JavaScript).

- Why XoR is very important in the Crypto world

XOR (Exclusive OR) is crucial in cryptography due to its unique properties:

Simplicity: XOR is a basic operation that is fast and simple to implement.
Reversibility: XOR is its own inverse, meaning if you XOR a value with another, you can recover the original by XORing the result with the same value again.
Bitwise Operation: Works at the bit level, making it useful for various cryptographic algorithms.
Building Blocks: Essential in many cryptographic operations, such as stream ciphers and key mixing in block ciphers.
In cryptography, XOR's properties make it valuable for creating simple and effective encryption and decryption processes.

- What are the differences between encryption, encoding, hashing, obfuscation, and signing?

Here's a brief overview of each term:

Encryption:

- Compare and contrast RSA, AES, ECC (ed25519), and ChaCha/Salsa in terms of encryption standards and implementations.

Here's a brief comparison of RSA, AES, ECC (Ed25519), and ChaCha/Salsa in terms of encryption standards and implementations:

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
Type: Asymmetric Encryption
Key Size: Typically 2048 or 3072 bits (recommended; can go up to 4096 bits)

Each algorithm has its strengths and is suited for different use cases based on performance, security needs, and resource constraints.

- What is Perfect Forward Secrecy and how does it apply to protocols like Signal?

Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) ensures that even if a server's private key is compromised, past communication sessions remain secure. It achieves this by using ephemeral keys for each session, which are not derived from the server's long-term private key.

How PFS Works:
Session Keys: Each session uses a unique, temporary key to encrypt data.
Ephemeral Key Exchange: During the session, ephemeral keys (temporary keys) are generated and used for encryption. After the session ends, these keys are discarded.
Key Compromise: If the server‚Äôs private key is compromised, it cannot be used to decrypt past communications because those used unique ephemeral keys.
Application in Protocols like Signal:
Signal Protocol: Uses PFS to ensure that even if an attacker gains access to long-term keys, past messages remain secure.
Encryption: Signal employs a combination of asymmetric and symmetric encryption with ephemeral keys for each communication session, ensuring that past communications cannot be decrypted with compromised keys.
PFS is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality of past communications in secure messaging systems.

- What are block cipher modes of operation, and how does AES-GCM work?

Block Cipher Modes of Operation determine how block ciphers process data that is larger than the block size. Each mode provides different features for confidentiality, integrity, and performance.

Common Modes:
Electronic Codebook (ECB): Encrypts each block independently. Not secure for large datasets due to patterns in plaintext being visible in ciphertext.
Cipher Block Chaining (CBC): Each block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. Provides better security than ECB but requires padding and is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks.
Counter (CTR): Converts a block cipher into a stream cipher by encrypting a counter value and XORing it with plaintext. Efficient and parallelizable but requires proper counter management.
Output Feedback (OFB): Encrypts an initial value (IV) and XORs it with plaintext to produce ciphertext. The same key is used for encryption and decryption.
Cipher Feedback (CFB): Similar to OFB but operates on a block-by-block basis. It is used for streaming data and can adapt to varying lengths.
AES-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode):
Components: Combines Counter (CTR) mode for encryption with Galois mode for authentication.
Encryption: Uses AES in CTR mode to encrypt the plaintext, providing confidentiality.
Authentication: Uses a Galois field multiplication to generate a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to ensure data integrity and authenticity.
Process:
Encryption: Data is encrypted using AES in CTR mode, where a nonce and counter are combined to create a unique keystream for each block.
Authentication: An authentication tag is computed over the ciphertext and additional authenticated data (AAD) to verify that the data has not been tampered with.
AES-GCM provides both encryption and authentication, making it a popular choice for secure communications.

- What are hashing functions and how are they used in security (e.g., MD5, SHA-1, BLAKE)?

Hashing Functions are algorithms that convert input data into a fixed-size hash value or digest. They are used for various security purposes due to their properties.

Properties of Good Hash Functions:
Deterministic: The same input always produces the same hash.
Fast Computation: Hashes are generated quickly.
Pre-image Resistance: It's hard to reverse-engineer the original input from the hash.
Second Pre-image Resistance: It's hard to find a different input that produces the same hash.
Collision Resistance: It's hard to find two different inputs that produce the same hash.
Examples and Use Cases:
MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5):

Hash Size: 128 bits (16 bytes)
Use Cases: Was commonly used for checksums and digital signatures.
Security: Considered weak due to vulnerabilities to collision attacks.
SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1):

Hash Size: 160 bits (20 bytes)
Use Cases: Used in various security applications and protocols, including SSL/TLS and digital certificates.
Security: Now considered insecure because of vulnerabilities to collision attacks.
BLAKE2:

Hash Size: Variable (up to 512 bits)
Use Cases: Used in cryptographic applications, file integrity checks, and more.
Security: Designed to be faster and more secure than MD5 and SHA-1. Resistant to known cryptographic attacks.
Applications in Security:
Data Integrity: Verifying data has not been altered by comparing the hash before and after transmission.
Password Hashing: Storing hashed versions of passwords rather than plaintext. This enhances security, especially with the use of salts.
Digital Signatures: Hash functions are used to create a hash of a message that is then signed, ensuring both integrity and authenticity.
Cryptographic Hash Functions: Integral to various cryptographic algorithms and protocols, ensuring secure data encryption and integrity.

- What are Message Authentication Codes (MACs) and how does HMAC work?

Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are cryptographic codes used to verify the integrity and authenticity of a message. They ensure that the message has not been tampered with and confirm its origin.

HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)
HMAC is a specific type of MAC that uses a cryptographic hash function combined with a secret key. It is used to provide both data integrity and authentication.

How HMAC Works:
Key and Message: HMAC requires two inputs: a secret key and a message.

Hash Function: It uses a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256, SHA-1).

Process:

Key Padding: If the key is shorter than the block size of the hash function, it is padded. If it is longer, it is hashed to the hash function‚Äôs output size.
Inner Hashing: The padded key is XORed with a constant ipad (inner padding), concatenated with the message, and hashed.
Outer Hashing: The result is XORed with a constant opad (outer padding) and hashed again.
Output: The final hash value is the HMAC, which acts as the MAC.

Example of HMAC Calculation:
If using HMAC-SHA256:

Key: Secret key (e.g., k).

Message: Data to be authenticated (e.g., m).

HMAC-SHA256(k, m) = H((k ‚äï opad) || H((k ‚äï ipad) || m))

‚äï denotes XOR.
ipad and opad are specific padding constants.
|| denotes concatenation.
H is the SHA256 hash function.
Security and Applications:
Integrity: Ensures the message has not been altered.
Authentication: Verifies the message came from the expected sender.
Uses: Common in secure communications, API authentication, and data integrity checks.

- What is entropy in the context of cryptography, and how are PRNGs (pseudo-random number generators) used?

Entropy in cryptography refers to the measure of randomness or unpredictability in a system. It represents the amount of uncertainty or information content, which is crucial for creating secure cryptographic keys and ensuring the unpredictability of cryptographic operations.

Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs)
PRNGs are algorithms used to generate sequences of numbers that mimic the properties of random numbers. They use deterministic processes but aim to produce sequences that are sufficiently unpredictable for cryptographic purposes.

How PRNGs Work:
Seed: PRNGs start with an initial value called a seed. The seed is used to initialize the generator and determine the starting state.

Algorithm: Based on the seed, PRNGs use a mathematical algorithm to produce a sequence of numbers. These numbers appear random but are actually generated in a deterministic manner.

Output: The sequence of numbers generated by the PRNG is used for cryptographic operations like key generation, initialization vectors, or random values in protocols.

Types of PRNGs:
Linear Congruential Generators (LCGs): Simple and fast but not suitable for cryptographic use due to poor randomness properties.

Mersenne Twister: Provides high-quality randomness and is widely used in non-cryptographic applications.

Cryptographically Secure PRNGs: Use algorithms designed to be secure against attacks and produce unpredictable sequences (e.g., /dev/random on Unix-like systems, or the CryptGenRandom API in Windows).

Security Considerations:
Entropy Source: PRNGs should be seeded with high-entropy sources to ensure randomness. Poor entropy can lead to predictable sequences.
Cryptographic PRNGs: For secure applications, use PRNGs specifically designed for cryptographic purposes, as they are engineered to provide strong randomness and resist attacks.
Applications:
Key Generation: Creating encryption keys.
Session Tokens: Generating secure tokens for authentication.
Random Nonces: Producing unpredictable values for security protocols.

- How do entropy buffer draining and methods of filling the entropy buffer impact cryptographic security?

Entropy Buffer Draining refers to the depletion of the entropy pool or buffer used by a cryptographic system to generate random numbers. This can impact cryptographic security in the following ways:

Impact of Entropy Buffer Draining:
Reduced Randomness: When the entropy buffer is drained, the system may lack sufficient randomness, leading to predictable or weak cryptographic keys, which can be exploited by attackers.

Compromised Security: If the buffer is not properly replenished, cryptographic operations such as key generation or session token creation may become insecure, increasing the risk of vulnerabilities.

Methods of Filling the Entropy Buffer:
Hardware Sources: Devices like hardware random number generators (HRNGs) or True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) provide high-entropy data directly from physical processes (e.g., electronic noise).

Environmental Noise: Collecting entropy from system events or environmental sources (e.g., mouse movements, keyboard inputs, network traffic) to provide randomness.

Seed Collection: Gathering entropy from various system activities or user interactions to initialize the PRNG.

Best Practices:
Regular Replenishment: Ensure the entropy buffer is frequently updated with high-quality randomness to maintain secure operations.

Use Secure PRNGs: Employ cryptographic PRNGs designed to handle entropy depletion securely and provide strong randomness.

Monitor Entropy Sources: Implement measures to check and manage the health and sufficiency of entropy sources to avoid predictable random number generation.

By maintaining a well-managed entropy buffer and using secure methods for generating randomness, cryptographic security can be effectively preserved.

- What information do certificates contain, and how are they signed? Provide an example involving DigiNotar.

Certificates in a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) contain the following key pieces of information:

Subject: The entity (person, organization, or device) the certificate represents.
Public Key: The public key associated with the subject.
Issuer: The Certificate Authority (CA) that issued the certificate.
Validity Period: The start and end dates for which the certificate is valid.
Serial Number: A unique identifier for the certificate.
Signature Algorithm: The algorithm used to sign the certificate.
Signature: The actual digital signature of the CA over the certificate's data.
Signing Certificates:
Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR): The subject generates a CSR containing their public key and other identifying information.
CA Verification: The CA verifies the information in the CSR.
Certificate Creation: The CA creates the certificate by including the subject's information, public key, and validity period.
Signing: The CA signs the certificate using its private key, creating a digital signature that validates the authenticity and integrity of the certificate.
Example Involving DigiNotar:
DigiNotar was a Certificate Authority that faced a significant security breach in 2011:

Attack: Attackers compromised DigiNotar's internal systems and issued fraudulent certificates for domains such as google.com.
Impact: These fake certificates were used for man-in-the-middle attacks, allowing attackers to intercept and decrypt secure communications.
Response: The breach led to DigiNotar's certificates being removed from major browsers' trust stores, and the CA was eventually shut down.
The DigiNotar incident highlighted the importance of secure certificate issuance and the impact that a compromised CA can have on global internet security.

- What is the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and how does it provide secure storage for certificates and authentication data?

Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a hardware-based security component that provides secure storage and management of cryptographic keys, certificates, and other sensitive data.

Key Features of TPM:
Secure Storage: TPM provides secure storage for cryptographic keys, passwords, and certificates, protecting them from unauthorized access.
Hardware-Based Protection: TPM uses hardware-based mechanisms to prevent tampering and unauthorized access to the stored data.
Cryptographic Operations: TPM can perform cryptographic operations, such as encryption and signing, within the chip itself, ensuring that sensitive data never leaves the hardware.
Platform Integrity: TPM can help verify the integrity of the platform by measuring and reporting the state of the system during the boot process.
How TPM Provides Secure Storage:
Key Storage: TPM generates and stores cryptographic keys securely. Private keys never leave the TPM, ensuring they are protected from extraction.
Secure Authentication: TPM can securely store authentication credentials and perform authentication operations, such as signing or verifying, within the module.
Encryption: TPM can encrypt sensitive data, such as certificates, using keys stored within the TPM. This ensures that data is protected even if the device is physically compromised.
Binding and Sealing: TPM can bind data to a specific platform or state, and seal (encrypt) data such that it can only be decrypted when the platform is in a known and trusted state.
Overall, TPM enhances security by ensuring that critical security data and operations are protected from software-based attacks and unauthorized access.
