# SOC 1 and SOC 2 Compliance

SOC 1 and SOC 2 are both types of compliance reports developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), but they serve different purposes and focus on different areas of an organization’s operations.

## SOC 1 Compliance
- Purpose: SOC 1 (Service Organization Control 1) focuses on the controls at a service organization that are relevant to the user entities' financial reporting. It is specifically designed to assess the internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR).
- Audience: The primary audience is the auditors, controllers, and other financial professionals of the client organization who need to understand how a service organization’s controls affect the client’s financial statements.
- Content: The report covers the service organization's controls that impact the financial statements of the clients. These controls might include processes related to payroll processing, transaction processing, or data management that could affect financial reporting.
- Types of Reports:
1. Type I: Describes the service organization’s system and the suitability of the design of controls at a specific point in time.
2. Type II: Provides a description of the service organization’s system, the suitability of the design, and the operating effectiveness of controls over a period of time (typically 6 months).

## SOC 2 Compliance
- Purpose: SOC 2 focuses on the controls at a service organization related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. It is more comprehensive than SOC 1 and is not solely focused on financial reporting.
- Audience: The primary audience includes customers, partners, regulators, and other stakeholders interested in understanding how the service organization manages data and ensures security, availability, confidentiality, and privacy.
- Content: The report assesses the service organization’s controls related to one or more of the five Trust Service Criteria (TSC):
1. Security: Protection of data against unauthorized access.
2. Availability: System availability for operation and use as agreed upon.
Processing Integrity: Ensuring that system processing is complete, accurate, and timely.
3. Confidentiality: Protection of confidential information.
4. Privacy: Personal information is collected, used, retained, disclosed, and disposed of properly.
- Types of Reports:
1. Type I: Examines the design of controls at a specific point in time.
2. Type II: Evaluates the effectiveness of controls over a period of time.

## Summary
SOC 1 is about financial controls relevant to financial reporting.
SOC 2 is about controls relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.
Organizations often pursue SOC 2 compliance, especially those in the technology or data services sectors, to demonstrate their commitment to high standards in data security and management.
