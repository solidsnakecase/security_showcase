- How does file compression work?

File compression reduces the size of files by removing redundant data. Here's a basic overview:

Compression Algorithms:

Lossless Compression: Reduces file size without losing any data (e.g., ZIP, GZIP, PNG).
Lossy Compression: Reduces file size by removing some data, which may lead to quality loss (e.g., JPEG, MP3).
Processes:

Encoding: Data is transformed into a more efficient format using algorithms. For instance, in ZIP files, repeated data sequences are replaced with shorter codes.
Dictionary-Based Compression: Commonly used phrases or sequences are replaced with shorter tokens (e.g., Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression).
Run-Length Encoding (RLE): Sequences of repeated characters are replaced with a single character and a count (e.g., compressing "AAA" to "3A").
Examples:

ZIP: Uses a combination of methods like DEFLATE for compressing files.
JPEG: Uses lossy compression by discarding some image data to reduce file size.
Compression can significantly reduce storage requirements and transmission times but may require decompression to access the original data.

- What are stateless and stateful requests?

Stateless Requests:

Definition: Each request from a client to a server is independent and contains all necessary information. The server does not retain any session information between requests.
Example: HTTP is inherently stateless. Each request is separate, and the server doesn’t remember previous interactions.
Stateful Requests:

Definition: The server maintains session information across multiple requests from the same client. This state information is used to provide continuity and context between requests.
Example: An online shopping cart. The server remembers what items a user has added to their cart across different pages or visits. This is often managed using sessions or cookies.
Stateful interactions are often used in applications requiring context or continuity, while stateless interactions are simpler and more scalable but require additional mechanisms to manage state if needed.

- How is the state of a request saved in HTTP?

In HTTP, state is managed using mechanisms such as:

Cookies: Small pieces of data stored on the client-side by the browser. Cookies are sent with each HTTP request to the same domain, allowing the server to recognize and maintain user sessions.

Sessions: Server-side storage associated with a unique session ID sent to the client as a cookie. The server uses this ID to retrieve session data, maintaining state across multiple requests.

URL Parameters: State information can be included in the URL (e.g., query strings), allowing the server to understand context from the URL itself.

Local Storage / Session Storage: Web storage mechanisms that allow the client to store data persistently (local storage) or for the duration of a page session (session storage).

These methods help HTTP, which is stateless by design, to maintain continuity and manage user sessions effectively.

- What are Certificate Transparency Logs?

Certificate Transparency (CT) logs are publicly accessible logs that record all issued SSL/TLS certificates. They are designed to provide a way to monitor and audit the issuance of certificates, ensuring that certificates are issued correctly and to help detect fraudulent or misissued certificates.

Key Points:

Public Record: CT logs are publicly viewable and searchable, allowing anyone to verify that a certificate was issued.
Monitoring: Domain owners can monitor these logs to ensure no unauthorized certificates have been issued for their domains.
Auditing: Helps in auditing and detecting misissued or malicious certificates, which can be used in attacks.
CT logs are an essential part of a broader security strategy to enhance trust and transparency in the SSL/TLS certificate ecosystem.

- What is the difference between Remote Code Execution, Remote Command Execution, Code Injection, Command Injection, and RCE (Remote Code Execution)?

Here's a brief differentiation:

Remote Code Execution (RCE):

Definition: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on a remote system.
Example: Exploiting a web server vulnerability to run a script on the server.
Remote Command Execution (RCE):

Definition: Similar to RCE, but specifically involves executing system commands remotely.
Example: Exploiting a vulnerability in a web application to run system commands on the server.
Code Injection:

Definition: Injecting malicious code into a vulnerable application that is then executed.
Example: Inserting malicious SQL into a query string to alter database behavior (SQL Injection).
Command Injection:

Definition: Injecting malicious commands into a system command that is executed by the application.
Example: Inserting ; ls into a web form that gets passed to a shell command, listing files on the server.
RCE (Remote Code Execution):

Definition: A broad term for scenarios where an attacker executes code remotely. It can include both remote command execution and other forms of remote code execution.
In essence, while RCE and Remote Command Execution involve executing code or commands remotely, Code Injection and Command Injection refer to the methods of injecting malicious input to achieve these exploits.

- Are open-source projects more or less secure than proprietary ones?

The security of open-source vs. proprietary projects isn't inherently better or worse but depends on several factors:

Transparency:

Open Source: Code is publicly accessible, allowing many eyes to review and identify vulnerabilities. This can lead to quicker identification and patching of security issues.
Proprietary: Code is closed, which limits review to a smaller group, potentially missing vulnerabilities.
Responsiveness:

Open Source: Often benefits from a broad community of contributors and faster updates.
Proprietary: Updates and fixes depend on the vendor’s timeline and resources.
Complexity:

Open Source: Can sometimes suffer from complexity due to contributions from diverse sources.
Proprietary: May have a more controlled development environment but can still be complex.
Vendor Support:

Open Source: Support can vary, and reliance on community forums and documentation might be necessary.
Proprietary: Typically includes formal support, which can be advantageous for critical issues.
Ultimately, the security of any project depends on its development practices, the quality of its code, and how actively it is maintained and reviewed.

- What is the difference between SSL Connection and SSL Session?

SSL Connection:

Definition: A transient, secure communication link established between a client and a server using SSL/TLS.
Scope: It is active only for the duration of the data transfer session.
Establishment: Every new connection requires a handshake to establish security parameters.
SSL Session:

Definition: A reusable state maintained between a client and server that stores security parameters from previous connections.
Scope: It persists across multiple connections and allows for faster establishment of new connections by reusing parameters.
Purpose: Reduces the need for a full handshake on subsequent connections, improving performance.
In summary, an SSL connection is a single, temporary interaction, while an SSL session allows for multiple connections using previously negotiated parameters.
