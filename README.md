# Security Showcase

This is a simple collection of scripts written to try to help showcase my talents for my upcoming interview as well as any future interviews.  Chances are you will not find this very useful if you are part of the general public, as these tools are incredibly basic and there are more advanced/complete tools written.<p>

The purpose of this repo is simply to demonstrate that I can code quickly and effectively on various cybersecurity subjects.  Some of them may not be complete, based on the short time between the creation of this repo and the scheduled interview.<p>

***I also decided to include notes/common questions to create an all-in-one study guide/knowledge showcase as well***

## Cyphers / encryption algorithms

Implement a cypher which converts text to emoji or something.
Be able to implement basic cyphers.

## Parse arbitrary logs

Collect logs (of any kind) and write a parser which pulls out specific details (domains, executable names, timestamps etc.)

## Port scanners

Write a port scanner or detect port scanning.

## Botnets

How would you build ssh botnet?

## Password bruteforcer

Generate credentials and store successful logins.

## Scrape metadata from PDFs

Write a mini forensics tool to collect identifying information from PDF metadata.

## Recover deleted items

Most software will keep deleted items for ~30 days for recovery. Find out where these are stored.
Write a script to pull these items from local databases.

## Malware signatures

A program that looks for malware signatures in binaries and code samples.
Look at Yara rules for examples.
